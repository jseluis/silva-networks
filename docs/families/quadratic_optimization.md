# `quadratic_optimization` Reproduction Dossier

**unconstrained differentiable quadratic equilibrium.** This dossier connects the source mechanism to its SILVA
implementation, compact evidence, replaceable components, and source-scale route.
Existing tests and notebooks remain the executable authority.

!!! info "Evidence boundary"
    The mechanism is `compact-verified` in the package suite.
    The final source-scale stage remains `planned` until the cited data, complete
    optimization budget, checkpoints, and evaluation protocol have actually run.

## Governing Equation

The domain-level state contract is

$$
0\in\mathcal A_\theta(z^\star;x)+\mathcal B(z^\star),\qquad y=Q_\psi(z^\star).
$$

The implementation registry specializes it operationally as

```text
z_star = z_star - alpha(Q z_star + c(x))
```

Define the root residual

$$
R_\theta(z;x)=z-T_\theta(z;x).
$$

At a regular equilibrium, differentiating
\(R_\theta(z^\star;x)=0\) gives

$$
\frac{\partial z^\star}{\partial x}
=
\left(I-\frac{\partial T_\theta}{\partial z}\right)^{-1}
\frac{\partial T_\theta}{\partial x}.
$$

This identity explains why the forward residual, the conditioning derivative,
and the adjoint linear solve must be diagnosed separately from the task metric.

## What Is Preserved

- first-order equilibrium whose root is an unconstrained quadratic minimizer

## What Can Be Replaced

Each item below is an explicit control rather than an undocumented modification:

- parameterize the Hessian or downstream objective
- state dimension
- linear-system conditioning
- batched objectives

## Constructor and Shape Contract

```python
quadratic_optimization(in_dim: 'int', state_dim: 'int', *, ridge: 'float' = 1.0, step_size: 'float' = 0.2, config: 'SolverConfig | None' = None, reengage: 'bool' = True)
```

The transition must preserve the declared equilibrium-state shape even when the
encoder, branch operators, constraints, solver, and readout are replaced. Test the
transition by itself before testing the complete root solve.

## Progressive Experiment Ladder

### 1. Equation and tensor contract

**Objective:** Make the state, conditioning variables, operator, and readout explicit.

Procedure:

- Write and evaluate the family equation: `z_star = z_star - alpha(Q z_star + c(x))`
- Declare every tensor axis, boundary, mask, graph, or physical unit.
- Check the transition output has exactly the same shape as the equilibrium state.

Acceptance checks:

- finite transition values
- shape-preserving state update
- all conditioning variables affect the intended branch

Evidence target: `contract-verified`.

### 2. Primitive mechanism reconstruction

**Objective:** Build the retained source mechanism from replaceable modules.

Procedure:

- first-order equilibrium whose root is an unconstrained quadratic minimizer

Acceptance checks:

- primitive modules expose trainable parameters and gradients
- mechanism-specific invariance or constraint check passes
- direct transition evaluation is deterministic under a fixed seed

Evidence target: `compact-verified`.

### 3. Public abstraction equivalence

**Objective:** Verify that the assembled family evaluates the same transition as its primitives.

Procedure:

- Copy the primitive module parameters into the public family constructor.
- Evaluate one transition and one complete equilibrium with identical inputs.
- Compare outputs, residuals, and parameter gradients with declared tolerances.

Acceptance checks:

- transition outputs agree
- equilibrium residual is finite and decreases
- primitive and assembled gradients agree on the compact case

Evidence target: `compact-verified`.

### 4. Compact real or analytic task

**Objective:** Exercise training, evaluation, diagnostics, and serialization end to end.

Procedure:

- Use the cited notebook's deterministic compact fixture before replacing it with source-scale data.

Acceptance checks:

- record task metric
- record fixed-point residual
- record gradient agreement
- record runtime
- checkpoint reload reproduces the recorded prediction
- result record contains data and configuration fingerprints

Evidence target: `compact-verified`.

### 5. Official-data subset

**Objective:** Validate the complete source data path before spending the full budget.

Procedure:

- Acquire the cited data and preserve its official split, preprocessing, units, and metric.
- Freeze preprocessing, split logic, metric code, and checkpoint format.
- Run a deterministic subset large enough to expose batching and memory failures.

Acceptance checks:

- dataset receipt and checksum are stored
- resume and evaluation paths reproduce the same subset metric
- memory and runtime are measured rather than estimated

Evidence target: `subset-verified`.

### 6. Source-scale reproduction or declared extension

**Objective:** Run the cited protocol, or change it explicitly as a SILVA extension.

Procedure:

- Acquire the cited data and preserve its official split, preprocessing, units, and metric.
- Build the same SILVA family with source-aligned task modules and scale controls.
- Run forward, loss, backward, checkpoint resume, and metric validation on a small shard before the complete experiment.
- problem distribution, conditioning, objective definition, solver tolerance, and error

Acceptance checks:

- all required artifacts are archived
- reported metrics use the cited evaluation protocol
- every architectural or training deviation is listed
- claims match the achieved evidence status

Evidence target: `planned`.

## Data, Access, and Storage

Candidate datasets:

- analytic positive-definite quadratic programs

Authoritative routes:

- https://github.com/jseluis/silva-networks

Access obligations:

- Follow the cited repository and dataset terms, then record source revisions and archive checksums.

Storage planning:

- Measure one processed sample, estimate the complete split, and budget raw data, processed shards, checkpoints, optimizer state, and diagnostics separately.

Preprocessing record:

- record dataset version, split, normalization, shape convention, and seed
- preserve masks, graph indices, boundaries, or physical units required by the domain

## Metrics and Current Evidence

Required metrics:

- task metric
- fixed-point residual
- gradient agreement
- runtime
- memory

This family is verified through its listed mechanism tests and executed notebook.
It is not included in a same-task comparison when another family does not share
its input, state, output, and loss contract. The absence of a comparison row is
therefore a scope decision, not missing implementation evidence.

Executed notebook paths:

Mechanism tests:

## Compact Defaults

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `tier` | `'smoke'` |
| `config` | `SolverConfig(solver='anderson', max_iter=12, tol=1e-05, alpha=1.0, history=3, ridge=0.0001, beta=1.0, stop_mode='relative', relative_eps=1e-08, anderson_batch_dims=1, track_residuals=True, reengage=True, backward_mode='implicit', backward_solver='gmres', backward_max_iter=20, backward_tol=1e-05, backward_stop_mode='relative', backward_relative_eps=1e-08, phantom_steps=1, phantom_tau=1.0, neumann_terms=5, shine_refine_steps=0, indexing=(), return_best=True)` |

## Full Defaults

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `tier` | `'full'` |
| `config` | `SolverConfig(solver='anderson', max_iter=60, tol=1e-05, alpha=1.0, history=6, ridge=0.0001, beta=1.0, stop_mode='relative', relative_eps=1e-08, anderson_batch_dims=1, track_residuals=True, reengage=True, backward_mode='implicit', backward_solver='gmres', backward_max_iter=80, backward_tol=1e-05, backward_stop_mode='relative', backward_relative_eps=1e-08, phantom_steps=1, phantom_tau=1.0, neumann_terms=5, shine_refine_steps=0, indexing=(), return_best=True)` |

Defaults establish a starting budget; the cited source protocol takes precedence
whenever reproduction is the claim.

## Source-Scale Checklist

- Acquire the cited data and preserve its official split, preprocessing, units, and metric.
- Build the same SILVA family with source-aligned task modules and scale controls.
- Run forward, loss, backward, checkpoint resume, and metric validation on a small shard before the complete experiment.

Benchmark-specific requirements:

- problem distribution, conditioning, objective definition, solver tolerance, and error

Required archived artifacts:

- machine-readable model and solver configuration
- dataset receipt with source revision, split, license, and checksum
- preprocessing and normalization record
- seeded training and evaluation log
- checkpoint and optimizer-resume state for trained experiments
- task metrics and equilibrium diagnostics in a machine-readable result
- runtime, peak-memory, device, precision, and dependency record
- declared deviations from the cited protocol

## Reporting Rule

Report the achieved evidence status, not the intended one. A compact or subset run
may validate the implementation and data path, but only a completed cited protocol
supports a source-scale reproduction statement. Modified operators are valuable
SILVA extensions when every deviation is named and measured.
